# IcyRiver
This project for the University of Antwerp, had the assigment to build a simple 2D game based on the classic Frogger. It was mostly focused on building a solid abstract codebase where game-engine and game-code were seperated. 
The engine is based on the SDL2 engine. This program is written in c++. 

The following image shows how to play the game:
